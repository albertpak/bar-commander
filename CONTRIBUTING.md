# How to contribute?

1. Review your development environment, so that it adapts to the needs of the project, you can read more [here](https://github.com/jesusgn90/bar-commander-api/wiki/Developer-environment).
2. Create an issue whenever you want to contribute something, this way we can see if it is viable or not and if it is already included in the roadmap or not.
3. Fork the repository and clone it to your machine. 
4. Make any changes or improvements you consider appropriate. Each change must be accompanied by its respective test using Mocha and Chai, you can see examples in the tests that are already implemented.
5. Once your modification passes the tests, it will be reviewed and accepted if applicable.
